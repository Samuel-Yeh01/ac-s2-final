# Movie List with Genres
Base on the pervious practice, I integrate the material and try to bulid a whole new website about movie List. 

## How the Movie List work
- add "Genre button" on the landing page.
- add "Collection button" on the movie card.
- add event listener on the "Collection button" & "Genre button"
- add "Genre Badges" at the end of movie cards.
- when clinking the "Collection button", it will help you to store your favorite movies at another list.
- if you want to check your favorite movies list, you can visit it at "favorite.html".
